            <p>With a strong background in both backend and frontend development, I’ve dedicated myself to building practical, user-centered applications. My core stack includes React, Flask, Django and MySQL but I'm always looking to learn new technologies to imporve my craft. And I’m also well-versed in managing complex databases and creating APIs for seamless data integration. I’ve also worked on several notable projects. I am currently looking for a job as a software developer</p>
